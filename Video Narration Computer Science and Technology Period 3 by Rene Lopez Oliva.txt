Our app is a guess the number app but instead of guessing the number you need to guess the color. Going into the app itself we have the main menu. It has a background screen, along with background music. It has a description of what to do with the three level button at the bottom. Clicking the the first colors level, 3 colors, it goes into the level screen. It has 3 colors along with the riddle to help you guess that color on the top, along with a back to main menu button just incase you chose the wrong level. Choosing the correct color the app would crash and reboot going into the main menu or if you choose the wrong color you'd go to the incorrect screen, both screens have back to main menu button so you can go and try again. The other two levels are the similar just with different colors and riddles. This the our Guess the Color app.
