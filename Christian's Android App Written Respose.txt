A problem that my partner and I came across was that every time a new screen was opened the main menu music kept looping over and over again. So, what we did was, we removed the music player from each screen. That made it so that the music would only replay on the main menu screen. So to fix that we unchecked the looping option so that after the music ended it would just be silent. I learned that making an app is a lot harder than I first thought. The process of making this app was challenging but fun. I have a rough understanding of how to make an app on the app inventor site and I had fun working on this project.
